### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I'm a software engineer located in Atlanta GA.

- I created [teelup.com](https://teelup.com) - a multi-functional online tool platform with a variety of tools to educate and enhance convenience.

Non tech:

- In my free time I enjoy playing instruments, and video games such as 2K, and FIFA (I'm a huge soccer fan).


Feel free to connect.
